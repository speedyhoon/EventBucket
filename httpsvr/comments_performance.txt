include svg sprite into jss css file:

WITH SPRITE:
	less requests made
	Less bandwidth used
	better gziping larger file???????
	better caching???????????????????
	JS 2 insert sprite can be done all at once
	less repaints??

WITHOUT SPRITE:
	faster load time of css
	faster load time of js
	better performance when outdated
	more JS files to execute but smaller jobs to do
__


HTTP SERVER SETTINGS::
prove only 1 request is made for combined CSS & JS
set content type headers to */* OR app/js,text/css OR app/js;text/css
set character encoding for html response to ascii

RESEARCH::
log the request times
	see the difference between SVG added and removed
	-- is there a millisecond delay for the client to request it????
slow down network speed to witness the impact
	--slower css rendering?? -- white page visible & repaints to blue
	--faster image inserting?
	--less round trip latency needed?
	
	
FAVICON::
	I think it would be better as a seperate resource
pros:
	less data to initially load on second request
	not needed imediatly - ok to show a short 5second delay
	less processing intensive immediatly
	base64 30% overhead not downloaded
	download favicon & cssJS at the same time
	httprequest overhead minimised if SPDY protocol used
cons
	does not display imediatly
	more http requests
