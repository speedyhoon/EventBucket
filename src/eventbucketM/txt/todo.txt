TODO::
Start Shooting
	Bug      Clicking on shooter names fast adds several score button rows
	Bug      Shooter totals are not displayed
	Bug      Shot Scores are not saved
	Bug      shooter scores come up wrong??????
	Bug      the last few shots are removed from start shooting
	Bug      calculating agg scores is slow
	Security stop users accessing agg ranges in total scores and startShooting
	Security Instead of saving shooter variables in a javascript file with an unique hash name. possibly use an ajax request instead. request POST for the settings of this event/range to change. respond with the new settings. then front end saves those settings in possibly web storage or the most browser compatible way. the local storage may become out of date quicker?- not sure on this.
	Feature  Add links to shooters via their ids. <a href=#123>MyShooter Name</a>
	Feature  Connect barcode reader to use shooterId links in StartShooting page <a href=#123>MyShooter Name</a>
	Research use event settings for ranges shots and sighters as base settings.

Event
	Feature  add a form to change a shooters details - name, club, change class/grade, age group

	Feature  set default club to current club
	Feature  when changing a shooters class/grade also update the aggregates for the old class/grade and the new class/grade

Event Settings
	Bug      classes for event are not working
	Bug      add agg range without any ranges should still display as an aggregate range
	Bug      don't allow shooter entry with invalid class/grades
	Feature  change the order of the ranges and aggregates
	Feature  aggs can add up other aggs
	Feature  event able to change class settings - number of shots
	Feature  re order ranges
	Feature  auto save ranges and aggregates via ajax or websocket silently.
	Feature  delete range

	Research connect ranges shots and sighters
	Research add custom classes and grades
	Research add gender to classes and grades
	Research archive event
	Research add option to change the order of ranges displayed on the scoreboard
	Research change range and aggregate form to use only one form instead of one for each table row

Scoreboard
	Bug      shooters scores that are zero should appear on the scoreboard. but no shots fired shot not display zero.  possibly use *pointers in structs to get around default values for int = 0 and string = "" and bool = false. this way bool = nil, sting = nil and int = nil
	Bug      fix a shooters score with only sighters and no shots can get a best score.
	Bug      some how sort the aggregate scores when identical by the last range that was shot. At the moment the scores when identical are flipping because of random orders
	Feature  put the next class onto a new page in print preview
	Feature  add gold silver bronze to aggregates
	Feature  add gold silver and bronze for each range
	Feature  add settings to configure gold silver and bronze for ranges. able to set just gold or set the first 5 places a set colour

Total Scores
	Bug      to generate scores for 358 shooters /random-data/totalScores=1 took 1h54m57.7925213s

	Feature  Favicon and Setup icon
	Feature  Add help docs into forms and table headings
	Feature  Connect 404 Missing page

Documentation
	Feature  add a page how to use EventBucket via multiple people at once.
	Feature 	setting up a network with two devices (ad-hoc)
	Feature  	setting up a network with multiple devices

BUILD SYSTEM
GO
	try & write source code with iGo
	remove from PRODUCTION
		Trace
		Info
		dev_mode_ functions & variables
		http gzip time elapsed function
	should I replace these lines to make it easier?
		"checkErr(...)" with "if ... != nil { Warning.Println(...) }"
		complex statement "checkErr(...)" with "err := ... if err != nil { Warning.Println(err) }"

JS
	listen to JS folder
	JSLint
	JSHint
	closure compiler
	build source maps
	save to /root/j/ without file extension

SASS
	listen to SASS folder
	validate/lint SASS
	add small svg & images as base64
	compile into css files
	minify css with CSSO
	save to /root/c/ without file extension

HTML
	Possibly use Go HAML implementation
	convert the templates to normal html file
	replace inner templates with their source files - like {{.NetworkAdaptor}}
	replace global template variables with variables from the build bot - like {{.BuildVersion}}=0.12.1202  {{.CurrentYear}}=2015 {{.DirCss}}=/c/ {{.DirJpeg}}=/j/
	replace file names with their newly built filename hashes - like {{.Favicon}}=c

The application should output optimised HTML that can't be minified any further.
1. search for id and classes in html to form a list of used rules site wide
2. find all occurrences of the rules in the css files
3. copy the used rules into a separate css file
4. rename the rules to as short as possible
5. replace all the html files with the shorter rules

6.	is it possible to make all elements custom html elements so they use less characters? i.e.
		<div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<div>foobar</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	would become
		<c>
			<c>
				<c>
					<c>foobar</c>
				</c>
			</c>
		</c>

7a. scan for and raise a warning for elements that have only one child. i.e.
		<c>
			<c>
				<c>
					<c>foobar</c>
				</c>
			</c>
		</c>
7b.	would become
		<c>foobar</c>



listen to HTML folder

	raise warning when found:
		Any issues listed at https://www.npmjs.org/package/html-minifier
		empty elements - think of a way to replace the empty elements via JS with the elements needed
		inline styles
		script tags in child templates
		double spaces
		default property values

	validate HTML5
	minify with a tool
	validate HTML5
	copy to /htm without file extension

SVG
	listen to SVG folder
	validate svg
	minify with SVGO
	copy to /root/v without file extension

Images
	manual process





MULTIPLE DEV iGO ENVIRONMENTS
---------------------------------------
Install the default Go package or zip		- if on shared server only one person needs to update it for everyone
Copy github packages used
on save convert iGo to Go
setup intillij with go plugin				- how to share editor settings?
share inspection settings
auto build html, sass, js


running the code locally=>>
Create a new git repo for the developer environment
Install the default Go package or zip
Copy github packages used
write batch file to convert iGo to Go on save
commit environment so other developers can checkout a new copy and develop quickly

score needs to be at least a multiple of five to have a center.

GOLANG OPTIMISER - Test if these list help to improve Go performance in some way
	Check functions are used
	shorten function names
	shorten variable names
	shorten constant names
	minify (strip tab characters)
	merge all code into one file
	compress .exe using goupx  https://github.com/pwaller/goupx
	replace commonly used strings with a shorter constant name
	inline functions if used only once
	remove Info & Trace logging
   strip comments - I don't think would have any effect


ACE IMPROVEMENTS
	remove double quotes from element attributes if characters are permitted
	add a mode to remove all newline characters

RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
	use one html resource for all css and JS. (Gulp.js concatenates the files together)
	css folder not needed
	js folder not needed
	join images together in a sprite,
	Or use a multi-layered svg? It might have better compression using gzip?
