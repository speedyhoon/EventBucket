licence summary page
	Feature  copy licence lamens terms from CC
	Feature  change footer licence logo to simpler svg one from google images

OPTIMISATION POTENTIAL:
scoreboard
	remove styles from triangle sort by svg and put them in the css fill:red;stroke:#000;
code
	find a way to output a trace of previous code to stdout so checkErr can be put back in and output the error from the previous executed line - this would improve code re-usability (DRY)
	remove html folder from install package
	move htm folder into core source code -- could this be an automatic thing?
	separate html from data - try to cache html for ever and send AJAX/Websockets for additional data.
	cache all AJAX/Websocket requests in local storage if the response flag is set to cache
		each page would have a single request with several tables that needed data like event-settings has many bits of data.

server
	add a far-future expiration date headers for favicon http://localhost/o/a
	move sortby.svg into css as base64

Installer
	Setup icon  - Also use as the favicon
	test that you can uninstall everything
	test that you can install over the top of an old folder!
	change eb.exe to run in minimized mode so it doesn't appear or show the logs
	add eb.exe to the task bar notifications
	maybe add uninstall old version?
	Add uninstall option to delete database

about page
	convert about icons to a sprite

settings
	add ability to change the default port number for EventBucket

Un-important optimisations or features:
all templates
	tidy up html templates and remove variables for globals and replace with $.SortRange http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16734503/access-out-of-loop-value-inside-golang-templates-loop
	set a formatting rule for variable names
all forms
	on submit redirect to form location id on form with #my_form_name to <fieldset id=my_form_name><h2>Heading</h2><form action=... etc
validation
	if no grade specified. set to the first one in the list. e.g. Target A or F CLass B
event show
	add edit button to edit existing shooter entries. Eventually change this to just onclick so no edit button is needed. And add a help logo with tooltips
installer
	change installer to 64bit if possible
scoreboard
	reduce the number of DOM elements 4962 > 4602 > 2837
		- join equal position cells together if they are equal
		grade separators should only have one element with fancy borders etc, not <tr><td colspan=99 class=cnr>{{CLASSLONG .Grade}} {{.Grade}}</td></tr><tr><td colspan=99 class=rS></td></tr>
		automatically don't show the ranges if they don't  have any scores for them.
		try to join teble cells between ranges where shooters don't have any scores.
	change the colspan quantity to the actual number required. so the pages validate properly
Event Ranges
	instead of having several properties for different statuses - locked, hidden, is on scoreboard, in progress, finished -- it might be better to save that info on a single attribute to save database space like
		int ( locked = 0|1, hidden = 0|2, scoreboard = 4|0, progress = 8|0, finished = 16|0 ) so locked && hidden && finished = 19
		string ( use initials)  so locked && hidden && finished = "LHF"
	change event grades from a string to a struct so that each grade can have their own shots quantity and sighters quantity set uniquely
http
	make a custom http.HandleFunc for each controller instead of the current setup http.ResponseWriter
		have one function per page listed in main()
		controller should know what it's own url is
		the controller should know what kind of page it is to automatically add menus and select templates.
		too much code is needed to setup a new page.

//TODO add all html sources to []byte constant in a new go file?

open archive event
	copy event

Additional Features:
forms

	auto focus back on the edited previous field when pressing [Enter] ---- use ajax update instead
	Add red error message when a save failed -- ajax
	Add green message when form saved correctly --- generic ajax handler of some kind listening to database update didn't fail!

event entry
	add gender to event entry
