INSTALLER::
	Setup icon

		setting up a network with two devices (ad-hoc)
		setting up a network with multiple devices
			use a wifi access point - or a home wifi router will do just fine.

	running a prizemeeting



START SHOOTING
	shooter scores come up wrong??????
	instead of saving shooter variables is a javascript file with an unique hash name. possibly use an ajax request instead. request POST for the settings of this event/range to change. respond with the new settings. then front end saves those settings in possibly web storage or the most browser compatible way. the local storage may become out of date quicker?- not sure on this.
scoreboard
	fix a shooters score with only sighters and no shots can get a best score.
	add gold silver bronze to aggregates
	some how sort the aggregate scores when identical by the last range that was shot. At the moment the scores when identical are flipping because of random orders

event settings
	classes for event are not working
	aggs can add up other aggs

event page
	add a form to change a shooters details - name, club, change class/grade, age group


annoying things
	auto save ranges and aggregates via ajax or websocket silently.
	add agg range without any ranges should still display as an aggreate range
	change the order of the ranges and aggregates
	shooters scores that are zero should appear on the scoreboard. but no shots fired shot not display zero.  possibly use *pointers in structs to get around default values for int = 0 and string = "" and bool = false. this way bool = nil, sting = nil and int = nil
	don't allow shooter entry with invalid class/grades


Additional Features:
forms
	Add generic button in set position for help and description. Display it by default for the first 90 days or so. Take the date from the mongo database as a global bool - show help by default = on or off.
	auto focus back on the edited previous field when pressing [Enter] ---- use ajax update instead
	Add red error message when a save failed -- ajax
	Add green message when form saved correctly --- generic ajax handler of some kind listening to database update didn't fail!
total scores
	to generate scores for 358 shooters /random-data/totalScores=1 took 1h54m57.7925213s
Installer:
	change eb.exe to run in minimized mode so it doesn't appear or show the logs
	add eb.exe to the taskbar notifications
	maybe add uninstall old version?
about page
	technologies?
	about me?
	additional Mac or linux versions may be available if you make it worth my while
	I don't support installing EventBucket on iOS(TM) or Android(TM). However they can happily access EventBucket via your local wifi network using the Google Chrome internet browser
update
	check for updates on startup
scoreboard:
	add gold silver and bronze for each range
	add settings to configure gold silver and bronze for ranges. able to set just gold or set the first 5 places a set colour
event entry
	add gender to event entry
event-settings
	add ability to change the default port number for EventBucket
	add custom classes and grades
	connect ranges shots and sighters
	add custom classes and grades
	add gender to classes and grades
	archive event
	add option to change the order of ranges displayed on the scoreboard
	change range and aggregate form to use only one form instead of one for each table row
open archive event
	copy event
start shooting
	use event settings for ranges shots and sighters as base settings.
all pages
	Add help docs into forms and table headings
	better support for displaying errors on screen and database errors
organisers
	move forms on organisers page to events, clubs and championship pages
Shooter entry:
	set default club to current club

event page
	if the event id doesn't match anything - doesn't exist display a create event page
home page
	archive events



//TODO add all html sources to []byte constant in a new go file?



Un-important optimisations or features:
scoreboard:
	put the next class onto a new page in print preview
event settings
	delete range
	instead of setting IsPrizeMeet to false, unset the value in the collection so it doesn't exist.
all templates
	tidy up html templates and remove variables for globals and replace with $.SortRange http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16734503/access-out-of-loop-value-inside-golang-templates-loop
	set a formatting rule for variable names
all forms
	on submit redirect to form location id on form with #my_form_name to <fieldset id=my_form_name><h2>Heading</h2><form action=... etc
validation
	if no grade specified. set to the first one in the list. e.g. Target A or F CLass B
event show
	add edit button to edit existing shooter entries. Eventually change this to just onclick so no edit button is needed. And add a help logo with tooltips
installer
	change installer to 64bit if possible
scoreboard
	reduce the number of DOM elements 4962 > 4602 > 2837
		- join equal position cells together if they are equal
		grade separators should only have one element with fancy borders etc, not <tr><td colspan=99 class=cnr>{{CLASSLONG .Grade}} {{.Grade}}</td></tr><tr><td colspan=99 class=rS></td></tr>
		automatically don't show the ranges if they don't  have any scores for them.
		try to join teble cells between ranges where shooters don't have any scores.
	change the colspan quantity to the actual number required. so the pages validate properly
Event Ranges
	instead of having several properties for different statuses - locked, hidden, is on scoreboard, in progress, finished -- it might be better to save that info on a single attribute to save database space like
		int ( locked = 0|1, hidden = 0|2, scoreboard = 4|0, progress = 8|0, finished = 16|0 ) so locked && hidden && finished = 19
		string ( use initials)  so locked && hidden && finished = "LHF"
	change event grades from a string to a struct so that each grade can have their own shots quantity and sighters quantity set uniquely
http
	make a custom http.HandleFunc for each controller instead of the current setup http.ResponseWritter
		have one function per page listed in main()
		controller should know what it's own url is
		the controller should know what kind of page it is to automatically add menus and select templates.
		too much code is needed to setup a new page.
server
	add a far-future expiration date headers for favicon http://localhost/o/a
	move sortby.svg into css as base64




OPTIMISATION POTENTIAL:
scoreboard
	remove styles from triangle sort by svg and put them in the css fill:red;stroke:#000;
code
	find a way to output a trace of previous code to stdout so checkErr can be put back in and output the error from the previous executed line - this would improve code re-usability (DRY)
	remove html folder from install package
	move htm folder into core source code -- could this be an automatic thing?
	separate html from data - try to cache html for ever and send AJAX/Websockets for additional data.
	cache all AJAX/Websocket requests in local storage if the response flag is set to cache
		each page would have a single request with several tables that needed data like event-settings has many bits of data.

Server add redirects to root folders. So /c/ would go to the home page or 404 not found.


BUILD SYSTEM
GO
	try & write source code with iGo
	remove from PRODUCTION
		Trace
		Info
		dev_mode_ functions & variables
		http gzip time elapsed function
	should I replace these lines to make it easier?
		"checkErr(...)" with "if ... != nil { Warning.Println(...) }"
		complex statement "checkErr(...)" with "err := ... if err != nil { Warning.Println(err) }"

JS
	listen to JS folder
	JSLint
	JSHint
	closure compiler
	build source maps
	save to /root/j/ without file extension

SASS
	listen to SASS folder
	validate/lint SASS
	add small svg & images as base64
	compile into css files
	minify css with CSSO
	save to /root/c/ without file extension

HTML
	Possibly use Go HAML implementation
	convert the templates to normal html file
	replace inner templates with their source files - like {{.NetworkAdaptor}}
	replace global template variables with variables from the build bot - like {{.BuildVersion}}=0.12.1202  {{.CurrentYear}}=2015 {{.DirCss}}=/c/ {{.DirJpeg}}=/j/
	replace file names with their newly built filename hashes - like {{.Favicon}}=c

The application should output optimised HTML that can't be minified any further.
1. search for id and classes in html to form a list of used rules site wide
2. find all occurrences of the rules in the css files
3. copy the used rules into a separate css file
4. rename the rules to as short as possible
5. replace all the html files with the shorter rules

6.	is it possible to make all elements custom html elements so they use less characters? i.e.
		<div>
			<div>
				<div>
					<div>foobar</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	would become
		<c>
			<c>
				<c>
					<c>foobar</c>
				</c>
			</c>
		</c>

7a. scan for and raise a warning for elements that have only one child. i.e.
		<c>
			<c>
				<c>
					<c>foobar</c>
				</c>
			</c>
		</c>
7b.	would become
		<c>foobar</c>



listen to HTML folder

	raise warning when found:
		Any issues listed at https://www.npmjs.org/package/html-minifier
		empty elements - think of a way to replace the empty elements via JS with the elements needed
		inline styles
		script tags in child templates
		double spaces
		default property values

	validate HTML5
	minify with a tool
	validate HTML5
	copy to /htm without file extension

SVG
	listen to SVG folder
	validate svg
	minify with SVGO
	copy to /root/v without file extension

Images
	manual process





MULTIPLE DEV iGO ENVIRONMENTS
---------------------------------------
Install the default Go package or zip		- if on shared server only one person needs to update it for everyone
Copy github packages used
on save convert iGo to Go
setup intillij with go plugin				- how to share editor settings?
share inspection settings
auto build html, sass, js


running the code locally=>>
Create a new git repo for the developer environment
Install the default Go package or zip
Copy github packages used
write batch file to convert iGo to Go on save
commit environment so other developers can checkout a new copy and develop quickly
