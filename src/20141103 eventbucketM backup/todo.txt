TODO::
INSTALLER::
	Setup icon
	
	test the installer on windows XP
	test that you can uninstally everything

EVENTBUCKET::
	add a licence page
		copy licence lamens terms from CC
		view full licence page?

	running a prizemeeting

	add CC logo to the about page

	
START SHOOTING
	shooter scores come up wrong??????
scoreboard
	fix a shooters score with only sighters and no shots can get a best score.
	add gold silver bronze to aggregates
	some how sort the aggregate scores when identical by the last range that was shot. At the moment the scores when identical are flipping because of random orders

event settings
	aggs can add up other aggs

	
event page
	add a form to change a shooters details - name, club, change class/grade, age group
	
	
annoying things
	auto save ranges and aggregates via ajax or websocket silently.
	add agg range without any ranges should still display as an aggreate range
	change the order of the ranges and aggregates
	shooters scores that are zero should appear on the scoreboard. but no shots fired shot not display zero.  possibly use *pointers in structs to get around default values for int = 0 and string = "" and bool = false. this way bool = nil, sting = nil and int = nil
	don't allow shooter entry with invalid class/grades


Additional Features:
total scores
	to generate scores for 358 shooters /random-data/totalScores=1 took 1h54m57.7925213s 
Installer:
	change eb.exe to run in minimized mode so it doesn't appear or show the logs
	add eb.exe to the taskbar notifications
	maybe add uninstall old version?
about page
	technologies?
	about me?
	additional Mac or linux versions may be available if you make it worth my while
	I don't support installing EventBucket on iOS(TM) or Android(TM). However they can happily access EventBucket via your local wifi network using the Google Chrome internet browser
update
	check for updates on startup

all pages

	better support for displaying errors on screen and database errors
organisers
	move forms on organisers page to events, clubs and championship pages
Shooter entry:
	set default club to current club
	when changing a shooters class/grade also update the aggregates for the old class/grade and the new class/grade
event page
	if the event id doesn't match anything - doesn't exist display a create event page
home page
	archive events



Un-important optimisations or features:
scoreboard:
	put the next class onto a new page in print preview
event settings
	delete range
	instead of setting IsPrizeMeet to false, unset the value in the collection so it doesn't exist.
all templates
	tidy up html templates and remove variables for globals and replace with $.SortRange http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16734503/access-out-of-loop-value-inside-golang-templates-loop
	set a formatting rule for variable names
all forms
	on submit redirect to form location id on form with #my_form_name to <fieldset><h2>Heading</h2><form id=my_form_name action=... etc
validation
	if no grade specified. set to the first one in the list. e.g. Target A or F CLass B
event show
	add edit button to edit existing shooter entries. Eventually change this to just onclick so no edit button is needed. And add a help logo with tooltips
installer
	change installer to 64bit if possible
scoreboard
	reduce the number of DOM elements 4962 > 4602 > 2837
		- join equal position cells together if they are equal
		grade separators should only have one element with fancy borders etc, not <tr><td colspan=99 class=cnr>{{CLASSLONG .Grade}} {{.Grade}}</td></tr><tr><td colspan=99 class=rS></td></tr>
		automatically don't show the ranges if they don't  have any scores for them.
		try to join teble cells between ranges where shooters don't have any scores.
	change the colspan quantity to the actual number required. so the pages validate properly
Event Ranges
	instead of having several properties for different statuses - locked, hidden, is on scoreboard, in progress, finished -- it might be better to save that info on a single attribute to save database space like
		int ( locked = 0|1, hidden = 0|2, scoreboard = 4|0, progress = 8|0, finished = 16|0 ) so locked && hidden && finished = 19
		string ( use initials)  so locked && hidden && finished = "LHF"
	change event grades from a string to a struct so that each grade can have their own shots quantity and sighters quantity set uniquely
http
	make a custom http.HandleFunc for each controller instead of the current setup http.ResponseWritter
		have one function per page listed in main()
		controller should know what it's own url is
		the controller should know what kind of page it is to automatically add menus and select templates.
		too much code is needed to setup a new page.
server
	add a far-future expiration date headers for favicon http://localhost/o/a
	move sortby.svg into css as base64




OPTIMISATION POTENTIAL:
scoreboard
	remove styles from triangle sort by svg and put them in the css fill:red;stroke:#000;
code
	remove html folder from install package
	move htm folder into core source code -- could this be an automatic thing?
	separate html from data - try to cache html for ever and send AJAX/Websockets for additional data.
	cache all AJAX/Websocket requests in local storage if the response flag is set to cache
		each page would have a single request with several tables that needed data like event-settings has many bits of data.
