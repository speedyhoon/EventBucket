Overwhelming and Stressful for beginners traveling to a new range by themselves

<h2>What where some points that were not expected?</h2>
Uncovered cheating in the 2013 Victorian champion of champions team match. Refused to organise scores for the following year. Scores where modified on paper compared to shots fired. I tried to fix the mess and retrieve the correct scores, but after 45 minutes I gave up. EB scoreboard was thrown out and incorrect cores where beemed correct.
No work was done on EB for the following 6 months and I also withdrew from shooting.
