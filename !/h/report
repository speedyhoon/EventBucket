<h2>What is target rifle shooting?</h2>
<h2>Brief history of Victorian Target Rifle Shooting</h2>
	VRA formed in 1860's
	Williamstown closed in 1992
	Stawell Rifle Club lengthened their range in 2003
		they now to Match rifle shooters and sometimes recieve shooters internationally
	Competitor numbers have slowly been dwindling for many years
<h2>What is a target Rifle competition like?</h2>
Overwhelming and Stressful for beginners traveling to a new range by themselves
Takes a long time to start heading home

<h2>What where some points that were not expected?</h2>
Uncovered cheating in the 2013 Victorian champion of champions team match. Refused to organise scores for the following year. Scores where modified on paper compared to shots fired. I tried to fix the mess and retrieve the correct scores, but after 45 minutes I gave up. EB scoreboard was thrown out and incorrect cores where beemed correct.
No work was done on EB for the following 6 months and I also withdrew from shooting.

<h2>competitors systems?</h2>


<h2>Interview questions for EventBucket Opinion.</h2>
what was good about eventbucket<br>
what was bad about eventbucket<br>
No one was ever interested in useing EB. Why do you think that was?<br>
how could EB be changed to appeal to a wider ausience?<br>
do you think EB made Prize Meetings better? - more organised?<br>
do you think Cam communicated poorly and no no one ever knew what was going on?<br>
Did EB ever perform poorly?<br>

<h2>Interviewees?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Mick</li>
	<li>Carra</li>
	<li>Pete</li>
	<li>Leo Stigger</li>
</ul>

<h2>What didn't work well</h2>
<ul>
	<li>ace HTML templating. biggest problem was adding spaces between elements was awkward. No syntax hilighting. sometimes file extension would open in a zip extraction program when editing files not on my normal developer workstation.</li>
	<li>Second monitor failed three times.</li>
	<li>IntelliJ IDEA
		<ul>
			<li>Displays false positives with golang syntax errors and unresolved variables</li>
			<li>External file changes are not supported. Files fixed by build bot are not auto updated</li>
			<li>Editor is slow</li>
			<li>when network drive is disconnected constant java error popups and unable to refresh project to see files again.</li>
			<li></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>grunt build tools. lots of configuration - time consuming for not much gain</li>
	<li>gulp build tools. waisted time with trying out plugins that don't work, debugging etc. others have had similar experience. errors are not handled properly or are poor/error prone to crashes for some plugins. Difficult to decipher poor documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What worked</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Build bot can fix common Golang programming mistakes. Just run the executable in a directory. no need to setup an IDE and programming environment.</li>
	<li>Git - helps keep track of changes. Some that are not good enough for product can be rolled back. Backup</li>
	<li>Buildbot runs on an old networked laptop. off loads processing. Best for external monitor</li>
	<li>build EB on slower hardware that the target audience has. reduces problems with intensive CPU tasks by discovering them earlier.</li>
	<li>run BuildBot and EB in CompileDeamon so they auto recompile whenever code is changed in their files</li>
</ul>
