EventBucket Mission Satement:
	Build the simplest website possible
	Only add frameworks/packages where it will safe significant time/resources.
	Target audience: "outback" Australia with limited internet connection & speed (if available)
		Before the National Broadband Network scheme north western Victoria farms had available
			poor ADSL - 100km from the closest node no ADSL2+ 35% packet loss
			satelite - running at 150% capacity. Peek periods averaged 1.76KB/s download
			3G wifi - not available - next door neibour erected a 4m tall arial ~ 40+dB - erratic connectivity in windy, super hot(mirages) rain, stormy weather, lighting,
			dialup - two phone lines required - billed on time rather than traffic.


Javascript
	CoffeeScript
	The idea of simplifying Javascript and writing less code to do more is a good one. However I disagree on a few of the default behavior implementations.
	functions return the last written. Often handy but also a pain if you have to write return undefined everywhere

	the amount of javascript code it generates is more than hand coded javascript.

	code can be confusing/difficult to read without parenthesis

	It doesn't assist with dynamic typing

	more complex & slower build server

	jQuery
	When EventBucket was first prototyped in 2012, jquery was a 81KB minified download. That was 76KB larger than the rest of the home page combined.
	Often when jquery seemed handy to use I knew I was doing something wrong or too complicated & it could be written better.
